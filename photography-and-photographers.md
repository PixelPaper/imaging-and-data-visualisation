#Photography and Photographers

Knowing when, how and where to use images in your work is an essential tool all aspiring designers need to master. While many designers commission photographers to take the images they need for any given project, on occasions a clients budget simply doesn’t stretch to allow for this additional expense. 

This is when having the ability to take your own photographs can become a big asset. Not only can you charge for the service, it can also give you the edge over other designers who do not have these skills.

I have retained a page on (currently under reconstruction) [pixelpaper.org](http://www.pixelpaper.org/photography.php) that will cover some of what I went through on Friday.

Rather than list all of the photographers mentioned during the lecture you will (and should) learn much more by researching some of the other names on the list. Include a few of your favourites in your Design Journal. 

The [Photography Now](http://photography-now.net) website is an excellent resource for kicking your research off. And don’t just pick a few photographers from the first list of names you come across. Take a look through a number and choose those whose work particularly inspire you.

There are obviously other sources which you should (or rather must) research. The following are a few other notable sites worth checking out. Please do research your own too.

Here is a link to National Geographic Photo Director’s, [David Griffin](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_griffin_on_how_photography_connects.html) talk on the narrative of images. **If you didn’t turn up to Friday’s lecture you should watch it.**

As shown during Friday’s lecture, [Chris Jordan](http://www.chrisjordan.com) is more artist than photographer. Jordan uses photographs to create stunning images from common statistics to deliver political and environmental messages. Jordan's ten minute talk on [Ted Talk's](http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_jordan_pictures_some_shocking_stats.html) is well worth checking out.

###Smartphone Photography
To help you along, here are a couple of links on smartphone photography.

Don't over do it with the apps and filters it should not be about the effects but about the image.
