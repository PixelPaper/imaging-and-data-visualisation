#Photography and Photographers

Knowing when, how and where to use images in your work is an essential tool all aspiring designers need to master. While many designers commission photographers to take the images they need for any given project, on occasions a clients budget simply doesn’t stretch to allow for this additional expense. 

This is when having the ability to take your own photographs can become a big asset. Not only can you charge for the service, it can also give you the edge over other designers who do not have these skills.

I have retained a page on (currently under reconstruction) [pixelpaper.org](http://www.pixelpaper.org/photography.php) that will cover some of what I went through on Friday.

Rather than list all of the photographers mentioned during the lecture you will (and should) learn much more by researching some of the other names on the list. Include a few of your favourites in your Design Journal. 

The [Photography Now](http://photography-now.net) website is an excellent resource for kicking your research off. And don’t just pick a few photographers from the first list of names you come across. Take a look through a number and choose those whose work particularly inspire you.

There are obviously other sources which you should (or rather must) research. The following are a few other notable sites worth checking out. Please do research your own too.

[Magnum Photos](http://www.magnumphotos.com)


Here is a link to National Geographic Photo Director’s, [David Griffin](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_griffin_on_how_photography_connects.html) talk on the narrative of images. **If you didn’t turn up to Friday’s lecture you should watch it.**

As shown during Friday’s lecture, [Chris Jordan](http://www.chrisjordan.com) is more artist than photographer. Jordan uses photographs to create stunning images from common statistics to deliver political and environmental messages. Jordan's ten minute talk on [Ted Talk's](http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_jordan_pictures_some_shocking_stats.html) is well worth checking out.

###Smartphone Photography
To help you along, here are a couple of links on smartphone photography.

Don't over do it with the apps and filters it should not be about the effects but about the image.

#Harmony and Proportion

To follow up on a question I received recently. It was regarding using Instagram as the method of delivery. NO. 

**I do not want to see Instagram used as the final method of delivery and image creation (filters) for your final 12 images.** You could use Instagram as a means to show some experimental material but nothing more.

Richard's talk this week looked at Harmony and Proportion in photography. During his talk Richard covered a number of inspiring, creative individuals.

Material on Henri Cartier-Bresson can be found at:

- [Magnum Photos](http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&ERID=24KL53ZMYN)

We looked at [Aleksandr Rodchenko](http://aleksandrodchenko.wordpress.com) and the Constructivists last semester but it is always worthwhile reviewing them again. As I have mentioned before, and will continue to do so, a solid understanding of design (and art) history will go a long, long way to enrich you as a designer. YOu can find some of his photographs on [Photoforager](http://www.photoforager.com/archives/alexander-rodchenko).

[Richard Feynman](http://www.feynman.com) He wrote an excellent book [Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/009917331X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=009917331X&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21)

We looked briefly at James Webb Young's [A Technique for Producing Ideas](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0071410945/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0071410945&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21) last year, it's a very valuable read and costing less than the price of a pint you would be foolish not to get it. 

As Richard said it is a little dated, he looks at advertising as the focus for his ideas, but the messages can be applied to any creative process and if adhered to will remain with you for life. 

You can find Richard's work and words on:

###Preparing images for screen and web

This piece from Six Revisions [The Comprehensive Guide to Saving Images for the Web](http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/comprehensive-guide-saving-images-for-web/) will take you through the necessary steps to ensure your images are properly prepared for presentation on the web.

Photoshop isn't the final step in this process. You can use a number of online tools and apps that will reduce your file size further making sure you website is as lean as possible.

- [ImageAlpha](http://pngmini.com)
- [Mass Image Compressor](http://icompressor.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/introduction-to-hassle-free-image.html)
- [Smuch.it](http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it)
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)

###Week 02 Research

This week you should consider looking at some of the different file formats we covered during the lecture and try saving one of your own images to see how small you can make it without losing too much quality. 

Place these on your Design Journal side-by-side and talk through the differences. Taking the results into some of the online compression services will allow you to create smaller files, try a few to see which works best and add the results to your Journal.


#Manufactured Fictions in the Age of Instagram

>"We shape our tools and there after our tools shape us."

This quote from Marshall McLuan is now more relevant than ever. Mobile technology is everywhere, anyone with a smartphone street can become photographers, [journalists,][13] cinematographers, all thanks to the incredible technology we carry with us.

Everyone is an expert, or so some think. In 2006 Flickr user [André Rabelo][17] submitted Henri Cartier-Bresson's world famous photograph, [Hyeres, France; 1932][18] to the Flickr group pool [Delete Me][1]. The group reviews submitted photographs decding whether they are good enough to stay on the site. Cartier-Bresson's timeless classic was deleted very quickly. 

This goes to prove that you shouldn't place too much emphasis on feedback from people who obviously don't know what they are talking about!

####The Nostalgia of Now

The age of the film camera is more-or-less behind us with single function, digital camera, now not far behind. The age of smartphone photography is well and truly here with apps such as [Hipstamatic][2] and [Instagram][3] helping turn the mediocre into the sublime.

With a multitude of filtered effects these apps, and similar others, allow us to make photographs taken today look as if they were shot decades ago. The effects can help create moods and atmospheres, developing personalities and creating a visual brand for individuals and groups. 

Scottish electronic music duo [Boards of Canada][4] used filtered images to evoke memories of hazy summer days. Colours are bleached or saturated, blurred or tinted, giving the impression they were shot decades ago, left in a dusty drawer to gracefully degrade.

Their visual approach matches the music beautifully, snippits of 1970s media are layered with analogue and electronic instruments creating a warm timeless nostalgic wash of sound.

In contrast [Tom Waits][5] has developed a visual persona that matches his gravelly voice and musical themes of degradation and dereliction. [Matt Mahurin's][6] photographs for Waits' [Mule Variations][7] album matches the music beautifully. The sepia-toned grainy images are reminiscent of portraits from the earliest days of photography while videos such as this for [Hold On][8] takes the style into the world of the moving image.

####Beyond the screen

Spartphone photography is finding its way increasingly into mainstream media. [Nick Laham's][9] Instagram iPhone photographs of the [New York Yankees][10] can now be licensed from [Getty Images.][11] 

When on location in Afghanistan, New York Times staff photographer [Damon Winter][12] used his iPhone to capture images of American troops.

>“Composing with the iPhone is more casual and less deliberate, and the soldiers often take photos of each other with their phones, so they were more comfortable than if I had my regular camera.”

The grainy, colour saturated effects added by Hipstamatic's filters bring a reality to the images no DSLR could hope to achieve.

The ability to record moments in time is now easier than ever, we can shoot stills or HD video and instantly share them with the rest of the world. While Instagram seeks to reach the masses for the quick gratification of seeing your image liked by complete strangers, other sites such as [Pictory][14] ask us to look a little more closely at, often the very personal story behind the image. 

[Instareel][15] from IMD graduate [Melissa Keizer][16] seeks to take Instagram one step further and encourages us to tell the story behind the image.
