#Meet Edward Tufte

Edward Tufte is one of the founding fathers of information graphics and data visualisation. 

Author of a number of publications on information design his most notable books are:
- [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392142/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0961392142&linkCode=as2&tag=eleventhirty-21)
- [Envisioning Information](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392118/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0961392118&linkCode=as2&tag=eleventhirty-21)
- [Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392126/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0961392126&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21)
- [Beautiful Evidence](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392177/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0961392177&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21)

Critical of PowerPoint use as a guidance rather than enlightening tool Tufte focussed on the way PowerPoint was used by NASA engineers in the events leading up to the [Space Shuttle Challenger disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster). The software is designed to persuade rather than inform, burying information details in crowded slides using bullets points with tiny type. The result for Challenger was catastrophic, vital data on the effect of low temperatures on O-ring integrity was overlooked, the launch was given the go ahead, one of the rockets developed a leak, exploded and all seven crew members tragically died.

He coined the term ‘chartjunk’ referring to displays of information that are either non-informative or obscure the information it is meant to present.

>Sometimes decorations can help editorialize about the substance of the graphic. But it's wrong to distort the data measures—the ink locating values of numbers—in order to make an editorial comment or fit a decorative scheme.

Tufte invented [Sparklines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline), which are very small line charts drawn without axes and coordinates used to present the general shape of variation in forms of measurement within a small space.

###Big Data

Making sense of data and the constant barrage of information we are subjected to on a daily basis is becoming the focus for many designers and developers who look to different methods and disciplines to help us understand and interact with this information.

Composer [JoAnn Kuchera-Morin](http://www.create.ucsb.edu/~musjkm), Professor of Media Arts and Technology has developed the [Allosphere Research Facility](http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/). The Allosphere is an immersive environment where scientists, engineeers, designers, etc are able to explore complex data in a virtual 3D environment.

[Aaron Koblin](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work.html), digital media artist and Creative Director of the Data Arts Team at Google is perhaps best known for his innovative uses of data visualisation and crowdsourcing.

A notable projects well worth looking at are Arcade Fire’s [Wilderness Downtown](http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com) the [Johnny Cash Project](http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com) and [Unnumbered Sparks](http://www.unnumberedsparks.com) the wonderful collaborative project with [Janet Echelman](http://www.echelman.com).


#Guest Lecturer – Jonny Campbell

This weeks lecture was hosted by [Jonny Campbell](http://jonnycampbell.com) creative lead at [Cargo](http://www.cargo.io) and [Brewbot](http://www.brewbot.io).

#The Visual Language of Data

Looking at a number of contemporary approaches to visualising data we focussed on a few key figures who are masters in this area.

David McCandless is an author, data-journalist and information designer who works in print, web and television. His website [Information is Beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net) explores a multitude of information sets, reinterpreting very complex data and presenting in ways that make the content very accessible.

[Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com) has a very distinctive style which grew from a personal project, the Feltron Annual Report. [Daytum](http://daytum.com), created by Felton allows users to gather their own data and see it visualised.

Turning data into an art form, [Brendan Dawes](http://brendandawes.com) pushes the boundaries of data visualisation, creating images of great beauty and complexity from information.

#Information Design  & Visual Storytelling

###Project 03 Data Visualisation

For this final project we want you to convert a set of statistics from the link below into something that can be easily understood by as wide an audience as possible.

[Global Death Penalty Statistics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdGJiUzRwTVhlM25DWDlPdjBmNURjOUE#gid=0)

At this stage research the subject as much as you can to investigate different approaches to data visualisation.

A few contemporary visualisations worth checking out are:

- [tweetping.net](http://tweetping.net)
- [How Different Groups Spend Their Day](www.nytimes.com//interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?hp)
- [The New York Times Innovation Portfolio](innovate.whsites.net)

Another look at [Christoph Niemann](http://www.gestalten.tv/motion/christoph-niemann) provided a number of different perspectives on approaches to client briefs. 

###Information Design

From the first marks on cave walls 40,000 years ago to the delivery of complex data in [theguardian.com](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-visualisation) today, we have been making sense of the world around us for millennia.

The Sumerians, Eqyptians, Mayans, Chinese and many other ancient cultures communicated through pictographic and logographic systems which grew and evolved into the modern written languages we use today. 

Pictographic systems are still widely used to helping us communicate on a global scale. Airport signage systems are a perfect example where pictographs have to communicate to a diverse range of cultures. 

Austrian socialist, [Otto Neurath](http://www.aiga.org/neurath-bliss-and-the-language-of-the-pictogram) developed a visual language of pictograms which he used to make sense of complex issues.

Neurath along with [Gerd Arntz](http://www.gerdarntz.org) developed the International System of TYpographic Picture Education or [Isotype](http://www.designhistory.org/Symbols_pages/isotype.html).

These became the foundations for the development of pictographic systems which have to work daily for a worldwide audience. Examples include road signage, airport directional systems and classics such as those created for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich by [Ulm School of Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulm_School_of_Design) co-founder [Otl Aicher](http://1972municholympics.co.uk/otl_aicher.php)

Taking a step back in time we can see how the human race has tried to make sense of the world arounfd them through a multitude of visual interpretations. The earliest maps of the earth such as [Theatre of the World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrum_Orbis_Terrarum) illustrated just how much of the world remained largely unexplored. Looking beyond the earth, the stars and planets have been a constant source of interest and mystery.

The Library of Congress’ [The Heavens](http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/world/heavens.html) collection depicts a multitude of views and theories on the skies.

###Visual Narratives

Where cave paintings marked mans first attempts of depicting what he saw around him through pictograms, they also served as visual narratives depicting hunting scenes or events. 

As legendary cartoonist Will Eisner stated,

>“The story form is a vehicle for conveying information in an easily absorbed manner.”

Visuall narratives have allowed humankind to communicate for millennia. Eisner's excellent book, [Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/039333127X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=039333127X&linkCode=as2&tag=eleventhirty-21) is a perfect introduction to visual storytelling. 

Another artist well worth looking at is [Scott McCloud](http://scottmccloud.com) and a great starting point has to be his [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/scott_mccloud_on_comics). His book, [Understanding Comics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/006097625X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=006097625X&linkCode=as2&tag=eleventhirty-21) is a must read.

Obvious forms of visual narratives are [graphic novels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel) where the image plays the lead in the storytelling. 




#06 The Art of Art Direction

What is an art director? 

Art directors often begin their careers as designers, or illustrators or photographers. Art directors are generally good at seeing the 'bigger picture'. Where a designer may focus on what looks right for a project an art director will look for what feels right.

Typographer, Jan Tschichold talked about design as:
>“A principle of identity between content and expression.” 

While art direction was not perceived as a discipline when Tschichold was practicing, this quote perfectly sums up what we now see as its role.

Art direction does not need to be a complex process, it can indeed be very simple. The act of choosing a filter in Instagram is an act of art direction, the choice of filter very often will change the mood of an image, altering the viewers perception of what the image is saying. The effects in this case are the tools the art director uses to deliver the feeling he or she is looking for.

Art direction encompasses all aspects of design, in simple terms it could be about the choice of an appropriate typeface or colour for a food packaging or it can influence the direction of the opening titles to a movie.

Tilden Freeman, Interpretive Designer summed up one meaning of art direction

>"The chief aim of interpretation is not instruction, but provocation."

Movie title sequences are an excellent example of art direction in action. In many ways they set the mood of the movie, building anticipation. Some excellent examples include:

- Saul Bass’ [Vertigo](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/vertigo)
- Kyle Cooper’s [Se7en](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/se7en) – there is an excellent overview of the processes behind the making of this sequence. 
- Zack Snyder’s [Watchmen](http://io9.com/5167732/easter-eggs-and-missing-parts-in-watchmens-titles)
- Richard Kenworthy’s [Scott Pilgrim](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world) and
- Geefwee Boedoe’s [Monsters Inc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GXmdUL3BDQ) his website is worth checking out too.

###Project 02.1

Just to shake things up a little we would like to you revist **one** of your book cover designs and redesign it for a different audience or genre. 

So if you have created a series of horror book covers how could one be redesigned to work for nursery school children? Alternatively how would you revisit a romance novel design for a group of hairy Hells Angels.

The choice is up to you just make sure your redesign is the polar opposite of the genre or audience your originals designs are intended for.


#05 Illustration: Hand to Mouse

#04 Illustrating the Cover

Richard looked at a number of different illustrators, designers and techniques that covered a wide range of approaches to cover design. 

[Penguin books][20] are the perfect vehicle for illustrating how a idea can be carried across a number of different outputs. The range of covers covered this week focussed on the concept and its execution which is core to any creative output. 

- [Alan Aldridge][26] this Wikipedia entry doesn't carry a lot of information (his own website isn't working at the moment) but you can also see a range of his work on his [Debut Art][26] space. 
- [Paul Hogarth][22] created numerous covers for Penguin including the excellent [Shakespeare Series][32]
- [David Gentleman][23] a very prolific illustrator, his work can also be seen on the walls of the London Underground at [Charing Cross][25] 
- [Coralie Bickford Smith][24] has designed a number of excellent series for Penguin from [Gothic Horror][30] to [Great Food.][31]

Also briefly looked at were:
- [Jillian Tamaki's][27] covers for the [Penguin Threads][28] series
- [Sanda Zahirovic's][29] excellent science fiction series for Orion Publishing

Over the next couple of weeks we will look at a wider range of illustrators and techniques and the importance and application of art direction in the development and execution of concepts.

###Project 02

####Design a series of three book covers

Choose ONE genre from the list below and research the subject. 

- Horror
- Romance
- Crime & thrillers
- Science Fiction & fantasy
- Childrens classics
- Alternatively, you could choose one author and look at a range of their books

You might want to try to keep the books you choose around the same time frame. So if you choose say Horror, go with a series of classics: Dracula, Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde. 

Research the subject exhaustively before you put pen/pencil to paper. 

*Ideally* read the books.

After you have researched the subject we want you to create at least **three cover designs**. You can produce more if you wish and include designs for the spine and back if you feel the urge.

You don’t have to be a great artist to achieve great results on this project.

It's all about capturing the idea core to the narrative, it really doesn't matter exactly how that is done, as long as the concept it good and the execution has been well presented. 

You can use illustration or collage or paper cuts or photography. Maybe even typography? Your finished pieces can be created by hand or on computer or a combination of both. It's up to you.

#03 Manufactured Fictions in the Age of Instagram

>"We shape our tools and there after our tools shape us."

This quote from Marshall McLuan is now more relevant than ever. Mobile technology is everywhere, anyone with a smartphone street can become photographers, [journalists,][13] cinematographers, all thanks to the incredible technology we carry with us.

Everyone is an expert, or so some think. In 2006 Flickr user [André Rabelo][17] submitted Henri Cartier-Bresson's world famous photograph, [Hyeres, France; 1932][18] to the Flickr group pool [Delete Me][1]. The group reviews submitted photographs decding whether they are good enough to stay on the site. Cartier-Bresson's timeless classic was deleted very quickly. 

This goes to prove that you shouldn't place too much emphasis on feedback from people who obviously don't know what they are talking about!

####The Nostalgia of Now

The age of the film camera is more-or-less behind us with single function, digital camera, now not far behind. The age of smartphone photography is well and truly here with apps such as [Hipstamatic][2] and [Instagram][3] helping turn the mediocre into the sublime.

[2]:http://hipstamatic.com
[3]:http://instagram.com

With a multitude of filtered effects these apps, and similar others, allow us to make photographs taken today look as if they were shot decades ago. The effects can help create moods and atmospheres, developing personalities and creating a visual brand for individuals and groups. 

Scottish electronic music duo [Boards of Canada][4] used filtered images to evoke memories of hazy summer days. Colours are bleached or saturated, blurred or tinted, giving the impression they were shot decades ago, left in a dusty drawer to gracefully degrade.

Their visual approach matches the music beautifully, snippits of 1970s media are layered with analogue and electronic instruments creating a warm timeless nostalgic wash of sound.

In contrast [Tom Waits][5] has developed a visual persona that matches his gravelly voice and musical themes of degradation and dereliction. [Matt Mahurin's][6] photographs for Waits' [Mule Variations][7] album matches the music beautifully. The sepia-toned grainy images are reminiscent of portraits from the earliest days of photography while videos such as this for [Hold On][8] takes the style into the world of the moving image.

####Beyond the screen

Spartphone photography is finding its way increasingly into mainstream media. [Nick Laham's][9] Instagram iPhone photographs of the [New York Yankees][10] can now be licensed from [Getty Images.][11] 

When on location in Afghanistan, New York Times staff photographer [Damon Winter][12] used his iPhone to capture images of American troops.

>“Composing with the iPhone is more casual and less deliberate, and the soldiers often take photos of each other with their phones, so they were more comfortable than if I had my regular camera.”

The grainy, colour saturated effects added by Hipstamatic's filters bring a reality to the images no DSLR could hope to achieve.

The ability to record moments in time is now easier than ever, we can shoot stills or HD video and instantly share them with the rest of the world. While Instagram seeks to reach the masses for the quick gratification of seeing your image liked by complete strangers, other sites such as [Pictory][14] ask us to look a little more closely at, often the very personal story behind the image. 

[Instareel][15] from IMD graduate [Melissa Keizer][16] seeks to take Instagram one step further and encourages us to tell the story behind the image.

###Week 03 Research

Review your photographs and reshoot any you feel don't fit the brief. You may use Photoshop or Lightroom or any other preferred photo editing tool to tidy up your images. Do not over do it, these tools should only be used to crop your images if necessary, adjust the exposure, brightness and contrast and if necessary add or remove a little saturation. There are numerous Photoshop tutorials online these [Photoshop essentials][18] may be useful.

If you haven't tried Instagram or Hipstamatic give them a go and post the results on your Design Journal.

#02 Harmony and Proportion

To follow up on a question I received recently. It was regarding using Instagram as the method of delivery. NO. 

**I do not want to see Instagram used as the final method of delivery and image creation (filters) for your final 12 images.** You could use Instagram as a means to show some experimental material but nothing more.

Richard's talk this week looked at Harmony and Proportion in photography. During his talk Richard covered a number of inspiring, creative individuals.

Material on Henri Cartier-Bresson can be found at:

- [Foundation Henri Cartier-Bresson](http://www.henricartierbresson.org/index_en.ht)
- [Magnum Photos](http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&ERID=24KL53ZMYN)
- [10 Things Henri Cartier-Bresson Can Teach You About Street Photography](http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2011/08/22/10-things-henri-cartier-bresson-can-teach-you-about-street-photography)

We looked at [Aleksandr Rodchenko](http://aleksandrodchenko.wordpress.com) and the Constructivists last semester but it is always worthwhile reviewing them again. As I have mentioned before, and will continue to do so, a solid understanding of design (and art) history will go a long, long way to enrich you as a designer. YOu can find some of his photographs on [Photoforager](http://www.photoforager.com/archives/alexander-rodchenko).

[Richard Feynman](http://www.feynman.com) He wrote an excellent book [Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/009917331X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=009917331X&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21)

We looked briefly at James Webb Young's [A Technique for Producing Ideas](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0071410945/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0071410945&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21) last year, it's a very valuable read and costing less than the price of a pint you would be foolish not to get it. 

As Richard said it is a little dated, he looks at advertising as the focus for his ideas, but the messages can be applied to any creative process and if adhered to will remain with you for life. 

You can find Richard's work and words on:

###Preparing images for screen and web

This piece from Six Revisions [The Comprehensive Guide to Saving Images for the Web](http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/comprehensive-guide-saving-images-for-web/) will take you through the necessary steps to ensure your images are properly prepared for presentation on the web.

Photoshop isn't the final step in this process. You can use a number of online tools and apps that will reduce your file size further making sure you website is as lean as possible.

- [JPEGmini](http://www.jpegmini.com)
- [ImageAlpha](http://pngmini.com)
- [Mass Image Compressor](http://icompressor.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/introduction-to-hassle-free-image.html)
- [Smuch.it](http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it)
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)

###Week 02 Research

This week you should consider looking at some of the different file formats we covered during the lecture and try saving one of your own images to see how small you can make it without losing too much quality. 

Place these on your Design Journal side-by-side and talk through the differences. Taking the results into some of the online compression services will allow you to create smaller files, try a few to see which works best and add the results to your Journal.


#01 Photography and Photographers

Knowing when, how and where to use images in your work is an essential tool all aspiring designers need to master. While many designers commission photographers to take the images they need for any given project, on occasions a clients budget simply doesn’t stretch to allow for this additional expense. 

This is when having the ability to take your own photographs can become a big asset. Not only can you charge for the service, it can also give you the edge over other designers who do not have these skills.

I have retained a page on (currently under reconstruction) [pixelpaper.org](http://www.pixelpaper.org/photography.php) that will cover some of what I went through on Friday.

Rather than list all of the photographers mentioned during the lecture you will (and should) learn much more by researching some of the other names on the list. Include a few of your favourites in your Design Journal. 

The [Photography Now](http://photography-now.net) website is an excellent resource for kicking your research off. And don’t just pick a few photographers from the first list of names you come across. Take a look through a number and choose those whose work particularly inspire you.

There are obviously other sources which you should (or rather must) research. The following are a few other notable sites worth checking out. Please do research your own too.

[National Geographic Photography](http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography)

[Magnum Photos](http://www.magnumphotos.com)


Here is a link to National Geographic Photo Director’s, [David Griffin](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_griffin_on_how_photography_connects.html) talk on the narrative of images. **If you didn’t turn up to Friday’s lecture you should watch it.**

As shown during Friday’s lecture, [Chris Jordan](http://www.chrisjordan.com) is more artist than photographer. Jordan uses photographs to create stunning images from common statistics to deliver political and environmental messages. Jordan's ten minute talk on [Ted Talk's](http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_jordan_pictures_some_shocking_stats.html) is well worth checking out.

###Smartphone Photography
To help you along, here are a couple of links on smartphone photography. 

[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2013/12/01/street-photography-gavin-harrison)

[techradar.phones](http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/smartphone-photography-tips-and-tricks-you-should-know-1189841)

[tgdaily](http://www.tgdaily.com/mobility-brief/80077-smartphone-photography-a-guide-for-taking-amazing-photos)

Don't over do it with the apps and filters it should not be about the effects but about the image.
